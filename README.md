# Dark (Red) Seafile

A dark CSS theme for [Seafile](https://seafile.com) with a customizable primary color --- red by default.

## Usage

### Get the compiled CSS

Currently, you'll have to compile the SCSS file yourself using [Sass](https://sass-lang.com).

An example command would be `sass main.scss main.css`.

CI/CD with continuous builds coming soonâ„¢.

### Configure your Seafile instance

Go to `System Admin > Settings > Custom CSS`, paste the compiled CSS code in and confirm.

After a reload, your Seafile should've gotten a visual uprade :)
