# Dark (Red) Seafile

A dark CSS theme for [Seafile](https://seafile.com) with a customizable primary color --- red by default.

## Usage

### Get the compiled CSS

You can either:
- Install [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) yourself and compile the CSS with `sass main.scss main.css`.
- Grab the auto-compiled file from [`css/main.css`](css/main.css).

### Configure your Seafile instance

Go to `System Admin > Settings > Custom CSS`, paste the compiled CSS code in and confirm.

After reloading the page, your Seafile should've gotten a visual upgrade :)
